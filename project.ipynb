    "Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy. [1]\n",

This process tipically involves a few steps starting with data collection, data preparation, model traing and evaluation.

The model is first trained for each shape based on an algorithm that evaluates the number of sides and angles, then tested. The model's objective is to recognize the shape.\n",
    "As the system has already been trained on a variety of forms, when it encounters a new one, it classifies it based on the number of sides and predicts the outcome."

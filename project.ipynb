    "Today machine learning is present in our daily life all around us. \n",
    "One very popular example is the e-commerce reccomendation engine where the website tracks browse history to build models that can predict user preferences. \n",
    "In other fields machine learning can analyse mamograms to predict tumors, perform spam filtering, predict traffic or can be used in self-driving cars technology to give just a few example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy. [1]\n",
    "\n",
    "Through the use of numerical approach machine learning focuses on building generic functions that can be trained to mimic other functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning works by utilizing mathematical algorithms that can be trained on existing data to recognize patterns and make predictions. This process tipically involves a few steps starting with data collection, data preparation, model traing and evaluation. The algorithms improve their behavior and precision as more data is gathered.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key point in Machine learning is the capability to \"learn from experience\" whereas in conventional programming rules and instructions are explicitly defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, machine learning revolves around leveraging data and algorithms to allow computers to \"learn from experience\", make predictions, and improve their performance. "

    "\n",
    "Supervised learning is the most common type of machine learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this approach the training data is labeled, meaning it has both the input data and the corresponding output variable.\n",
    "The model learns a mapping between the input (features) and the output (label) during the training process. Once trained, the model can predict the output for new, unseen data. [5]\n",
    "\n",
    "The diagram below ilustrates how supervised learning works on a dataset containing variety of forms such as such as squares, rectangles, triangles, and polygons. The model is first trained for each shape based on an algorithm that evaluates the number of sides and angles, then tested. The model's objective is to recognize the shape.\n",
    "As the system has already been trained on a variety of forms, when it encounters a new one, it classifies it based on the number of sides and predicts the outcome."
